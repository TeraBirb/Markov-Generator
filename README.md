# Markov Text Generator

## A Java program that takes in an input .txt file in the root directory and outputs to an output .txt file and the console, computer-generated text that resembles human speech.

###### Author: Isaiah C, May 2022 for CIS 36A: Java Programming course

Default settings: The program will read from "emma.txt" in the root directory and output to "output.txt" a 50-word paragraph.

The user may change the input .txt file by creating their own in the root directory. They have to change INPUT_FILE_NAME to their new .txt file on LINE 16.

The user may also change the output .txt file to any name they desire on LINE 17.

Finally, the user may change the number of words in their output text on LINE 18.

Special thanks to our professor, Ben.

Have fun,
